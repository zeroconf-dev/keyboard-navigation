# Focuser

import { Playground, Props } from 'docz';
import { Focuser } from '@zeroconf/keyboard-navigation/components/Focuser';
import { useCallback, useMemo, useRef } from 'react';

Every higher level component regarding keyboard navigation in this library
is build upon or partially implements features from the [`Fucuser`](/focuser) component.

The basic idea of the component is, that it is an invisible input field,
so it can be placed pretty much anywhere in the UI, without taking up space
and not have visual implications of any kind.

### Why is this needed?

In the web the only things that can have focus, and thus navigate between, are
**input fields**, **buttons**, **links**, **images** and **contenteditable**. So if one would go by
giving a `div` focus, we need to give something else focus, and then use sibling styling via CSS,
to make the user believe the `div` is in focus.

## Basic usage

<!-- {() => {
    const ref = useRef();
    const focus = useCallback(
        () => ref.current != null && ref.current.focus(),
        [ref],
    );
    const style = useMemo(() => ({
        height: 30,
        width: 200,
    }));

    return (
        <div>
            <Focuser ref={ref} />
            <div className="focus-renderer" style={style} />
            <button onClick={focus}>Focus the renderer!</button>
        </div>
    );
}} -->

<Playground>
    <div />
</Playground>
