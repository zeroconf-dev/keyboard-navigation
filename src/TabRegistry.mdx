# Tab registry

import { Playground, Props } from 'docz';
import { TabRegistry } from './TabRegistry';
import { Component } from 'react';

The core of this project lives inside this utility class and data structure.
A registry is basically just a glorified map, from an identifier to a focus function.
The registry keeps track of identifiers and their corresponding focus function, every focus
function has a two jobs, number is to focus its component it represents, and report back to
if it was successful. Their can be any number of reason why a focus call wasn't successful,
the most common one is if the component / input fields is in some kind disabled state.

## Data structure

The registry itself is powered by a doubly linked ordered set of identifiers and a map from an identifier
and its corresponding focus function, this means that an identifier can only be used once per registry,
hower it is possible to nest registries, so the identifiers only needs to be unique among its siblings.
